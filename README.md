# Maze-Final-Project
Helen Li and Felicity Ng's final project APCS2, Mr. K, period 6

Brief Description
A puzzle oriented game. The player traverses through a maze, solving puzzles in order to reach the center room, which contains the objective that would win the game. The puzzles could be spot-the-difference, bejeweled, repeat after me, sliding puzzle, memory game, etc.

5/25/15: Started working on maze and how to implement GameTile
5/26/15: Solidified how direction works in maze; North, East, South, West dependant + began/tried using keyPressed to                 navigate
         Fixed the bug of reading the file in with scanner
5/27/15: Tried to scan the maze in...but it's not work because of a processing bad character constant bug
5/28/15: Fixed scan for maze; started PuzzleTile game; can print image for Spot the Difference; Drew pictures for User                Interface
5/29/15: Worked on the Tile Puzzle Game
         Working on importing images drawn yesterday
5/29/15 (continued): broke git terminal
5/30/15: continued working on the tiles game; one tile is moving around. Still needs more work. Aim to finish this by Tuesday.
5/31/15: Continued working on graphics (drawing)
         Fixed the scanner thing in Processing by using loadStrings()

6/4/15:  A bit late, but worked on loading the direction images on the maze
         Helped set different modes for different screens
         Drew more images for Spot the Difference
6/5/15:  Displaying the arrow keys when the user moves around
         Displaying the Map Screen

6/7/15:  Made minimap display player's current location in the maze
         SpotTheDifference runs without problems independantly
         Created a basic format for puzzles so they could run in the maze (doesn't actually run in maze yet)
         Started to create inventory
         Decided on a definite way to put games into maze (Random doors, definite Boss location)
         Continued working on BossTile so it could check on inventory
         
What do we have as of 6/1?
INSTRUCTIONS: Look at Maze_Final_Project.pde (for bordered map) and PuzzleTileGame.pde (for Puzzle Tile game). Not much progress, but should be able to compile.
Not much :/ much but we have loaded a nice map, and we are beginning the games. More progress will come this week.
         
Things to do:
-Finish making the map appear and allow user to navigate (finish by Tuesday 6/2)
-Finish all games except Bejeweled (finish for Demo versions -- Bejeweled for final version if possible)
-Fighting the boss game (hopefully by this weekend -- maybe not)
-more to come :)
