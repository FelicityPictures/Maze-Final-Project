# Maze-Final-Project
Helen Li and Felicity Ng's final project APCS2, Mr. K, period 6

Brief Description
A puzzle oriented game. The player traverses through a maze, solving puzzles in order to reach the center room, which contains the objective that would win the game. The puzzles could be spot-the-difference, bejeweled, repeat after me, sliding puzzle, memory game, etc.

         SpotTheDifference runs without problems independantly
         Created a basic format for puzzles so they could run in the maze (doesn't actually run in maze yet)

What do we have as of 6/1?
INSTRUCTIONS: Look at Maze_Final_Project.pde (for bordered map) and PuzzleTileGame.pde (for Puzzle Tile game). Not much progress, but should be able to compile.
Not much :/ much but we have loaded a nice map, and we are beginning the games. More progress will come this week.

What do we have as of 6/8?
INSTRUCTIONS: Look at Maze_Final_Project.pde.
As of now, running it and pressing 'P' will only allow for the user to navigate around the map, but we already of about two of the games implemented.

         
Things to do:
-Finish making the map appear and allow user to navigate (DONE)
-Finish all games except Bejeweled (finish for Demo versions -- Bejeweled for final version if possible)
-Fighting the boss game (hopefully by this weekend -- maybe not)
-more to come :)
