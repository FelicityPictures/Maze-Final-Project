# Maze-Final-Project

Brief Description
A puzzle oriented game. The player traverses through a maze, solving puzzles in order to reach the center room, which contains the objective that would win the game. The puzzles could be spot-the-difference, bejeweled, repeat after me, sliding puzzle, memory game, etc.
